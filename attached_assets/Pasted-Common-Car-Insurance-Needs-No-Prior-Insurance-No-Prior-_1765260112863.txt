Need an SR-22 / FR-44?
If you need an SR-22 / FR-44, we can help:
An SR-22 is a certificate of financial responsibility, required for some drivers by their state or court order. An SR-22 is not a coverage or type of insurance, but a certification form filed with your state. This form serves as proof that your auto insurance policy meets the minimum Liability coverage required by state law. An FR-44 is like an SR-22 form in that it proves that a driver is carrying active Liability insurance that meets or exceeds state-minimum coverage requirements. The FR-44 is used in Florida and Virginia. You can request an SR-22/FR-44 when you buy a policy or have it added to your existing policy. You will need to purchase and maintain Liability insurance coverages to get a filing.


Need Rideshare Coverage?
We provide Rideshare coverage:
Bristol West offers Rideshare coverage as an optional endorsement. Rideshare coverage is a smart choice if you drive under a ridesharing platform like Uber® or Lyft®. Rideshare coverage fills the gaps between your personal insurance and any insurance provided by the ridesharing company, so you’re protected, whether you’re waiting for a ride request or dropping someone off. (Not available in all states.)


Don't own a car, but need Affordable Car Insurance?
Need Car Insurance, but don't own a car, we can help:
If you don’t own a car, or don’t have regular access to a vehicle, a Non-Owner (also known as Named Non-owner or Named Operator) Auto insurance policy might be right for you. If you cause an accident while borrowing a vehicle, a Non-Owner policy provides Liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage. It doesn't cover damages to the vehicle or your own injuries after an accident. However, this policy does insure you if you're liable for damages or injuries in an accident. An SR-22/FR-44 certificate of financial responsibility can be added and other Liability coverage may be available. (Not available in all states.)
