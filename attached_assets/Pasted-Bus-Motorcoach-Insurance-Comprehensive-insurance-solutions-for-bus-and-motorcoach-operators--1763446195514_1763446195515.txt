Frequently Asked Questions
Common questions about bus and motorcoach insurance coverage.

What are the minimum insurance requirements for bus operators?

Interstate bus operators typically need at least $5 million in liability coverage to comply with federal regulations. Our team can help you understand the specific requirements for your operation and ensure you meet all regulatory standards.

How can I reduce my bus insurance premiums?
Several factors can help reduce your bus insurance premiums, including implementing comprehensive safety programs, driver training, installing vehicle safety technology, maintaining a clean claims history, and choosing appropriate deductibles.

Does my bus insurance cover international travel?
