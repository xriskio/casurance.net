Are you using a hosted content management platform (for example, Blogger or WordPress)? In most cases, the platform submits your new content to search engines automatically. Check your platform's support articles.
If you've recently added or made changes to a page on your site, you can request that Google re-index your page using any of the methods listed here. You can't request indexing for URLs that you don't manage.

Crawling can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Be patient and monitor progress using either the Index Status report or the URL Inspection tool.

Requesting a crawl does not guarantee that inclusion in search results will happen instantly or even at all. Our systems prioritize the fast inclusion of high quality, useful content.
Use the URL Inspection tool (just a few URLs)
To request a crawl of individual URLs, use the URL Inspection tool. You must be an owner or full user of the Search Console property to be able to request indexing in the URL Inspection tool.

Keep in mind that there's a quota for submitting individual URLs and requesting a recrawl multiple times for the same URL won't get it crawled any faster.

Submit a sitemap (many URLs at once)
If you have large numbers of URLs, submit a sitemap. A sitemap is an important way for Google to discover URLs on your site. It can be very helpful if you just launched your site or recently performed a site move. A sitemap can also include additional metadata about alternate language versions, video, image, or news-specific pages.
