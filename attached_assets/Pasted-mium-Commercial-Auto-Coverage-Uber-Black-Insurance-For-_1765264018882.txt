What is Uber Black Insurance, and Do You Need It?
Uber Black insurance is specialized commercial auto coverage designed for professional drivers using luxury vehicles on the Uber Black platform. Unlike standard rideshare, your personal auto policy does not qualify you to drive for Uber Black—you must carry commercial auto insurance.

Personal auto insurance policies typically exclude coverage for commercial livery operations. This creates a dangerous gap that could leave you personally liable for accidents, vehicle damage, and passenger injuries while working.

Our Uber Black insurance bridges this gap completely. From the moment you turn on the app until the ride is complete, you're fully protected against third-party claims, vehicle damage, and liability—even if you're at fault.

Uber Black Requirements
Must hold commercial auto insurance (personal auto does not qualify)
Vehicle must meet luxury standards (black exterior, leather interior)
Vehicle must be no more than 5 years old
Drivers must maintain a high star rating (typically 4.85+)
Vehicle must pass Uber's inspection requirements

Commercial Auto Liability up to $1.5M CSL
Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage
Personal Injury Protection (PIP)
Comprehensive & Collision Coverage
Hired & Non-Owned Auto Coverage
